A Linux Kernel Engineer who enjoys poking at hardware until it works.
By day, I wrangle the kernel for Tizen smart devices at Samsung.
Before that, I was at Intel taming 100G networking drivers.

This blog is my field notebook for low level adventures in drivers,
performance tuning, eBPF, and bringing safe Rust to the kernel.
